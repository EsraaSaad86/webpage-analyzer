# Web Page Analyzer

This project is a web application that performs analysis of a given webpage URL.

## Project Structure

- `analyzers`: Contains various analyzers for webpage analysis.
- `configs`: Holds configuration files.
- `configuration`: Contains code related to configuration loading.
- `controllers`: Houses HTTP handlers for webpage analysis.
- `engines`: Includes the engine implementation for the application.
- `frontend`: Contains frontend assets like HTML and JavaScript files.
- `http`: Contains HTTP-related code, including responses and middleware.
- `middleware`: Holds middleware implementations.
- `mocks`: Contains mock implementations for testing purposes.
- `tests`: Includes unit tests for various components.
- `main.go`: Entry point of the application.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Go 1.22.2 installed on your system.
3. Update the `go.mod` file to reflect the correct Go version (if necessary).
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Run `go mod tidy` to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date.
6. Run `go run main.go` to start the server.
7. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Assumptions/Decisions

- **Concurrent Analyzer Execution:** The application assumes that executing analyzers concurrently would lead to better performance. Therefore, the analyzers are executed concurrently using goroutines.
- **Missing Information Handling:** In case of unclear requirements or missing information, decisions were made based on common practices and assumptions to ensure a functional and user-friendly application.
- **Logging:** Logging is implemented to provide information about the analysis process and any errors encountered.

## Possible Improvements

- **User Authentication:** Implementing user authentication for accessing the analysis feature could enhance security.
- **Enhanced UI:** Improving the user interface with more interactive features and better styling could enhance the user experience.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing more robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and provide informative error messages to users.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimizing the performance of the application, such as caching frequently accessed data or optimizing database queries, could improve response times.
- **Unit Tests:** Increasing test coverage by writing more unit tests for various components could ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
- **Dockerization:** Dockerizing the application would simplify deployment and ensure consistency across different environments.
- **Concurrency with Channels:** Utilizing Go channels for concurrency management could enhance the efficiency of concurrent operations, such as processing multiple requests simultaneously.
